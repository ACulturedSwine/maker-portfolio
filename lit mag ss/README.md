> Note: Below are the instructions for setting up the literary magazine. Of course, since you're (probably) not part of the literary magazine, you don't need to follow the "creating the form" bit. Just make sure to go to SETTINGS to install the triggers!
> Here's the link to the literary magazine spreadsheet demo: https://bit.ly/litmagdemo.

# Creating the spreadsheet (do this BEFORE the form)

1. Make a copy of the spreadsheet and put it into the folder for this year’s Lit Mag. Please make sure that you are doing this with your school account, as the school district doesn’t let you run Apps Scripts owned by a user outside of the organization!

2. Next, head on to the SETTINGS tab to set up the triggers (pressing the ‘thumbs up’ button next to Setup Triggers). This ensures that the features categorizing each submission, daily quote, highlighting invalid submissions, templating, and hiding sensitive information work. Now, we’re ready to create the form!

💡 After the Lit Mag year ends, deactivate the triggers (SETTINGS > press the "X" button next to Delete Triggers), otherwise some of them will continue running even if you’re not using them!                                                       

# Creating the form (do this AFTER copying the spreadsheet)

1. Make a copy of the form and put it in the master form folder, which is OUTSIDE of the Lit Mag Shared Drive. This is because forms with File Upload are not supported by shared drives as of yet, meaning that the form WON’T WORK if it’s not in another folder.

2. Open the form. If you see a notification telling you to create a new folder for the file upload, do that and move it into the master form folder.

3. Next, we’re linking the spreadsheet! Click on the “Responses” tab in the center and click on “Link to Sheets.”

4. Click “Select existing spreadsheet” and select the spreadsheet you just created. Open up the spreadsheet.

5. You should see now that the spreadsheet has a new sheet called “Form Responses.” Rename it as “MASTER LIST” exactly as how it’s written (all uppercase with a space in between).

6. In the “MASTER LIST” sheet:
Link “Title of your piece” to the Ratings Sheet, to provide a reference for editors while they review subs!
Freeze the first row (the one that has all the form questions, like “Title of piece” and “Type of piece”).  That way, the first stays on-screen no matter how far you scroll down the master list of submissions.

7. And… now you’re done! To make sure that everything’s running alright, try testing your new form by submitting to it! If your test submission populates into the sheet for its specific genre, then everything works! Hooray!
