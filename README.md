# Welcome to my maker portfolio repo! ðŸ‘‹

Here, I included any relevant files and supplementary instructions of use. Documentation of the development journey and demos video is included in SlidesRoom.

## Want to play with a tool?

**Literary Magazine Demo:** https://bit.ly/litmagdemo. Make a copy and install triggers on SETTINGS tab to set up!

**Polyphi Chrome Extension:** No installation on Chrome Web Store as of yet (my five dollars will be expended on crochet materials instead). To use it, go to the polyphi directory and follow the instructions for downloading/setting up.

**gink-go! (a scioly search tool):** https://home.sophli.me/bites/scioly-search.

## While you're at it, here's some music to enjoy

Made with Musescore, FL Studio, and the tiniest bit of tone-deafness. Music from demos video + bonus track.

## Thanks for coming, and stay cozy! â˜•
