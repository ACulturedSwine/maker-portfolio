# List of Lists üôå

Some of my favorite lists converted to markdown for your viewing pleasure.

## 1. Ideas üí°

### Revelations
* The best ideas spring from normalcy. If you are trying to think of something creative but cannot, go take a shower or something.
* The origami of life - each fold, many hidden, has great impact on final structure
* Symbiotic relationship between different people
* Age groups
* The best final tests are the least expected
* It doesn‚Äôt happen overnight (applies to many things)
* Importance of learning another language
  * Language = gateway to culture
  * Get good at it -> may even think that language‚Äôs certain words is better than your primary language
  * Many nuances, idioms, connotations w/ words- hard
* We are each in our own movie; the camera shot is just not good.
* It is easier (but worse) to do and reason than reason and do. (i.e. do and come up with an excuse than be logical and choose reasonably)
* Survival of self (selfishness as instinct) leads to the survival of the species
* Solution to bad memory = memorize number of things you need to do
* Solution to language restricting thought = think in images 
* Love people for goodness, hate people bc they don‚Äôt meet expectation of goodness - but limited snapshot
* Believe you can be good - just like any other time (essay - others are clearly bad - unknown that seems good prob like that too)
* Know the essential qualities of something (Marxist line of cognition/theory of knowledge - see ‚ÄúImprove Our Methods of Work to Strengthen Our Learning Ability and the Party‚Äôs line‚Äù in website)
* According to art teacher, artists constantly change their drawings so that‚Äôs why the beginning looks different from the end version - i thought they already had everything planned - seems obvious, but never realized it before (if that makes sense)

### Questions
* Is some part of human nature not changeable? If not, then to what degree is it changeable?
* Is it important to know what the author was thinking if the writing still affects you in a certain way regardless of original intention? - authorial intent
* Why carcinization?
* Does the shape / sound of a word seem to fit its meaning because one knows the meaning // Would it be different if one didn‚Äôt know // knew similarly structured words? Or do some words fit their meaning perfectly? (ex: sardonic - sounds negative - maybe bc sounds like satanic)
* Are/were all teachers nerds in their subject?
* Tradeoff of self for survival in society - fake personality, compliments, smile - more friends = more fake
* What would happen if we lived in a matriarchal society
* How do dictionary people come up with such thorough definitions using a limited amount of vocabulary
* Limits of computers? (ex: missing float decimal, not enough bits for data types - ex: Y2K‚Ä¶)

## 2. Language ‚úèÔ∏è

### Quotes
* ‚ÄúEverybody in the world was once a child. So in planning a new picture, we don't think of grown-ups, and we don't think of children, but just of that fine, clean, unspoiled spot down deep in every one of us that maybe the world has made us forget and that maybe our pictures can help recall.‚Äù ‚Äî Walt Disney
* To translate is not to dig for the One Rendering buried under the crusty layers of the original language. It is to peer at a cloth made during the day, unravel the fabric, then discover a way to weave it back together under a different light.
* The sun rose from the still, beautiful water / Into the bronze sky, to shine upon the gods / And upon men who die on the life-giving earth. (The Odyssey by Homer)
* ‚ÄúThe only paradise is paradise lost.‚Äù- Marcel Proust
* ‚ÄúWe are all here on earth to help others: what on earth the others are here for, I don't know.‚Äù
* ‚ÄúIf music be the food of love, plan on, / Give me excess of it; that surfeiting, / The appetite may sicken, and so die.‚Äù - William Shakespeare
* ‚ÄúYet each man kills the thing he loves‚Äù - Oscar Wilde
* ‚ÄúWithout their chloroplasts plants would be left like the rest of us, to eat what they find. Instead they hold out their green palms and catch light. If there is magic in the world, surely this is it: the descendants of tiny creatures in leaves, capable of ingesting the sun.‚Äù - Rob Dunn
